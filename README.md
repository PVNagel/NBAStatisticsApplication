# NBAStatisticsApplication
My personal attempt at making a C# WPF application show casing stats from www.balldontlie.io by learning to use an API, creating a nice GUI in WPF and making data visualization with charts, graphs and so on (in an attempt to learn).

DISCLAIMER:
This project was created in an attempt to learn and become better at WPF, APIs, WPF Data representation and more.
Everything is for educational purposes only.
